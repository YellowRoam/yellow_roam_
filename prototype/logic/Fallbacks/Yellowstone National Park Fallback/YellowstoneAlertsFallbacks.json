    "response": "Biscuit Basin is currently closed due to a hydrothermal explosion that occurred on July 23, 2024. This event has made the area unstable, and the parking lot, boardwalk, and Firehole River nearby are closed to all travel until further notice. The closure is a safety precaution in case another explosion occurs. Please check with the park's official website or a visitor center for updates.",

    "response": "Due to high water temperatures and low river flows, Yellowstone has implemented 2 p.m. daily fishing closures on the Madison River and tributaries, Firehole River and tributaries, and Gibbon River downstream of Norris Campground. These closures are to protect fish during vulnerable conditions. Fishing may resume at sunrise the following day. Always check local signage and park alerts before you fish.",

    "response": "Elk with calves are extremely protective and can be very aggressive, especially near Mammoth Hot Springs. Calves are often hidden near buildings or vehicles. Stay at least 25 yards away from elk at all times. If an elk acts agitated or charges, back away slowly and seek shelter. Avoid blind corners and always stay alert when walking in this area.",
