driving_weather_tips = [
    "★ Local Tip: Snow can fall any month in Yellowstone — even late spring and early fall. Drive cautiously on bridges and curves.",
    "★ Local Tip: Always carry extra food, water, and a blanket in your vehicle — storms can strand drivers for hours.",

    "★ Local Tip: Ice can linger on shady roads near Dunraven Pass and Craig Pass well into June.",
    "★ Local Tip: In winter, carry tire chains or AWD when crossing Bozeman Pass, West Yellowstone, or Togwotee Pass.",
    "★ Local Tip: Yellowstone's high-elevation roads may not reopen until late May or early June — check with NPS alerts before setting out."

camping_weather_tips = [
    "★ Local Tip: Use a 3-season tent with a strong rainfly — summer thunderstorms and cold nights are common.",
    "★ Local Tip: Don't camp in low-lying areas — sudden rainstorms can flood creek beds and tents fast.",
    "★ Local Tip: Store clothes and sleeping bags in waterproof bags or dry sacks to prevent soggy misery.",
    "★ Local Tip: Tent condensation is worse on clear, cold nights — vent your tent to avoid wet gear in the morning.",
    "★ Local Tip: Never leave your firewood uncovered — storms roll in fast and wet logs won’t burn at 8,000 feet."

general_awareness_tips = [
    "★ Local Tip: Expect four seasons in a single day — sun, sleet, wind, and snow are all possible in summer.",
    "★ Local Tip: Heat exhaustion and hypothermia can happen on the same trail in the same day — hydration and layering are key.",
    "★ Local Tip: Cell reception is unreliable across the park — download weather and offline maps in advance.",
    "★ Local Tip: Check hourly forecasts, not just daily — Yellowstone’s terrain creates extreme microclimates.",
    "★ Local Tip: Mammoth and the northern range often thaw early, but snowpack can persist on trails into July elsewhere.",
    "★ Local Tip: If thunder rolls in, seek cover immediately — Yellowstone is wide-open country and lightning strikes are real."
