    ],
    "response": "No, the springs are not drying up. Water levels in Mammoth Hot Springs fluctuate naturally as underground plumbing shifts. The system is dynamic, and while some terraces may appear dry at times, others are active. Overall activity remains consistent over time.",

    ],
    "response": "The white appearance comes from travertine, a form of limestone deposited by the hot water. When a spring dries up, the minerals remain behind, making the surface look white. Color in active springs is caused by thermophiles\u2014heat-loving microorganisms.",

    ],
    "response": "The water at Mammoth Hot Springs originates as rain and snow in the surrounding mountains. It seeps into the ground, gets heated underground, and dissolves limestone. When it re-emerges, it forms the travertine terraces seen throughout the area.",

    "response": "Mammoth lies outside the Yellowstone Caldera, but may still be heated by underground magma. Scientists think that heat could come from deeper volcanic activity connected to the same system as the Yellowstone Caldera, possibly via basaltic magma bodies.",
