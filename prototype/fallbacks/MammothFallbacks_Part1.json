    "response": "Mammoth is one of those spots locals always recommend. Start at the Albright Visitor Center to get your bearings, then stroll the boardwalks around the terraces \u2014 they\u2019re constantly changing with the hot water flow. In summer, drive the Upper Terrace loop. In winter, you can snowshoe the same path with steam rising all around. It's classic Yellowstone.",

    "response": "Fort Yellowstone is right in Mammoth, and you can walk through it yourself. Back in the late 1800s, the Army was called in to protect the park \u2014 they built those sturdy red-roofed buildings still in use today. Interpretive signs explain how the soldiers tackled poaching and laid the groundwork for the Park Service.",

For something mellow, the Beaver Ponds Trail is great for spotting wildlife. Swing by the visitor center first for trail conditions and bear updates.",
